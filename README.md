    - Saw a lack of fresh produce (fruits/veggies) available at UCSD
- `Our product` - A website where beginners can start Urban Gardening
    - Learn about necessary tools and resources to start gardening plus where to buy them
    - Watch tutorials to grow different houseplants, fruits, vegetables, and beginner friendly plants
    - Connect with on campus gardens to learn more about gardening

  - Shamita - `Mentor` 
  - Cecilia - `Frontend Develepor` 
  - Danny - `Frontend Develepor`
